In this repo, you will find all the scripts i wrote in the course of practicing bash scripting.
To run the bash scripts, you have to use Bash version 4+.
When running the bash version 4+, you have to give the absolute directory of the bash engine to run the code, otherwise, you system will use the default inbuilt bash engine to run the scripts. For example, /usr/local/bin/bash <script_here>.
